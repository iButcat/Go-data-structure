# Trie

A trie is a tree-like data structure whose nodes store the letters of an alphabet. By structuring the nodes in a particular way, words and strings can be retrieved from the structure by traversing down a branch path of the tree. Tries in the context of computer science are a relatively new thing.
The complexity of creating a trie is O(W*L) , where W is the number of words, and L is an average length of the word
